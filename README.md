# ðŸŒ¦ Weather Data Recorder for AgriWeather Insights

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project was developed as part of my **Summer Internship** at **AgriWeather Insights**.  
The **Weather Data Recorder** is a software tool that collects, stores, and visualizes weather data (temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed, etc.) to support data-driven decision-making for agriculture.  

The system aims to help farmers, researchers, and agricultural planners improve crop yield forecasting and farm management by leveraging accurate, historical weather records.
